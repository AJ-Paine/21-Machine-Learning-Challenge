# 21-Machine-Learning-Challenge
## About
This repository was built to test machine learning models from a dataset acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope.  The model will be a supervised classification model that will predict whether a potential planet is indeed a planet.

In this project, I utilized several sciket-learn libraries to test different classification models including K nearest neighbors, logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine.  For each model, the data was preprocessed by splitting into training and testing data plus scaling the numerical data.  The models were then tuned using GridSearch. Pandas and matplotlib were also used to import, clean and visualize the data. All of this was done inside of Jupyter Notebook.
